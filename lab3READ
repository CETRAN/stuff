Objective : To again experience in the use of repetition, character processing and robust input in a modular program.

Problem Definition:
  Write a C program to perform simple C arithmetic calculations. The user is to enter a simple expression
  (integer operator integer) such as: 15 + 30
  
  The Program is to extract the 2 operands and the operator , perform the indicated calculation and display the result.
  For example, 15 + 30 = 45.
  
  Operators should include +, -, *, /, and %.
  Operands are positive integers, no sign.
  Use getchar to input the expression
  Allow for variable spacing before the first operand and between operators and operands. (Zero, one, or more spaces).
  
  Aloow the user the option of entering another expression.
  Code a function for each operator to do the appropriate arithmetic operation (5 functions).
  No global variables. No string handing functions.
  No arrays.
  
  YOU MAY NOT USE ANY STRING HANDLING FUNCTIONS IN THIS PROGRAM
  You may only use input and output functions such as getchar and putchar.
  
  Output:
    Echo the input (both user prompts and user entered data).
    Print the whole expression with the result or an appropriate error message.
    Be sure your output data shows all valid and invalid test data and how your program handled it.
